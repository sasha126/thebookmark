You're standing at a crowded railway station. Waiting for a friend as you wait. Hundreds of people pass you by each one looks different. But when your friend arrives you have no problem picking her out of the crowd. Recognizing people's faces is something we humans do effortlessly. But how would you program a computer to recognize a person you could try to make a set of rules. For example, your friend has long black hair and brown eyes, but that could describe literally billions of people what is it about her that you actually recognize something about the shape of her nose or the curve of her chin? But can you put it into words? The truth is that we can recognize people without ever really knowing how we do it. We cannot describe every detail of how we recognize someone. We just know how to do it? The trouble is that to program a computer. We need to break the task down into its little details that makes it very difficult or even impossible to program a computer to recognize faces face recognition is an example of a task that people find very easy. But that is very, very hard for computers, these tasks are often called artificial intelligence or AI you're now going to learn about type of computing technique that can solve a lot of these AI problems and that's revolutionizing what computers can do. That technique is machine learning.
