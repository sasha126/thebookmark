 You're standing at a crowded railway station. Waiting for a friend as you wait. Hundreds of people pass you by each one looks different. But when your friend arrives you have no problem picking her out of the crowd. Recognizing people's faces is something we humans do effortlessly. But how would you program a computer to recognize a person you could try to make a set of rules. The truth is that we can recognize people without ever really knowing how we do it. We cannot describe every detail of how we recognize someone. The trouble is that to program a computer.

That technique is machine learning.
